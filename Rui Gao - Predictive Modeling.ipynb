    "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a U.S. government agency that makes sure financial companies treat their customers fairly. Their website allows customers of financial services to file complaints against financial companies and banks against unfair treatment if these companies are unable to resolve complaints to the customer’s satisfaction.\n",
    " \n",
    "When customers choose to complain to the CFPB, financial companies incur additional costs to resolve such complaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "On receipt, the CFPB routes complaints to the financial companies, who generally respond to the consumer within 15 days.  Once a response is provided, one of two things can happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tIn most cases, consumers accept the response or remediation offered by the financial companies, \n",
    "2.\tIn other cases, they choose to dispute the resolution offered by the company.  (flagged in the 'Consumer disputed?' field).  In these situations, the bank has to perform additional investigations, and possibly offer further relief to the customers.  As a result, the cost of dealing with disputes can be high.\n",

    "The cost structure:\n",
    "1.\tOn average, it costs the banks $100 to resolve, respond to and close a complaint that is not disputed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tOn the other hand, it costs banks an extra $500 to resolve a complaint if it has been disputed.  (This $500 is on top of the $100 they have already spent.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tExtra diligence: If the banks know in advance which complaints will be disputed, they can perform “extra diligence” during the first round of addressing the complaint with a view to avoiding eventual disputes.  Performing extra diligence costs $90 per complaint, and provides a guarantee that the customer will not dispute the complaint.  But performing the extra diligence is wasted money if the customer would not have disputed the complaint.\n"
